Project Description
Designed and developed an IoT-based Gas Leakage Detection System using Arduino UNO and MQ gas sensor to detect hazardous gases such as LPG and Methane. The system provides real-time monitoring and immediate alert mechanisms to enhance safety in residential and industrial environments.

Key Features
1.Real-time gas concentration monitoring
2.Detection of LPG, Methane, and smoke
3.Threshold-based alert mechanism
4.Buzzer and LED warning system
5.Scalable for cloud/IoT integration (ThingSpeak / Blynk)

Technologies & Components Used
1.Arduino UNO
2.MQ-2 / MQ-135 Gas Sensor
3.Embedded C (Arduino IDE)
4.LED and Buzzer
5.Basic IoT Integration Concepts

System Working
The MQ gas sensor continuously monitors gas concentration levels. When the detected gas level exceeds the predefined threshold value, the Arduino microcontroller activates the buzzer and LED as an alert signal. The system can be extended to transmit real-time data to cloud-based IoT platforms for remote monitoring.

Applications
1.Domestic gas leakage detection
2.Industrial safety systems
3.Smart home automation
4.Environmental monitoring

Future Enhancements
1.Integration with GSM/Wi-Fi module for SMS alerts
2.Mobile application for remote monitoring
3.Automated exhaust fan control system
